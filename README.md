# Practical - Try-Catch

SUMMARY

# A simple try-catch application was made in this practice.

# A program was written that asks the user to enter a number. When the user enters a valid number, it prints the square of this number on the screen.

# If the user makes an invalid entry (such as entering a letter or symbol instead of a number), it shows an error message saying "Invalid entry! Please enter a number."
